# Backend Deployment Guide

## Problem
Your local backend is working in development but not accessible from other devices or in production builds because it's running on a local IP which is not accessible from outside your network.

## Solution
Deploy your backend to a public hosting service so it's accessible from anywhere.

## Option 1: Deploy to Render (Recommended - Free)

### Step 1: Push Backend to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial backend commit"
git remote add origin your-github-repo-url
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `clinic-os-backend`
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `yarn install` (or `npm install` - build runs automatically via postinstall script)
   - **Start Command**: `npm start` (or `yarn start`)
   - **Port**: `3001` (or your configured port)

5. **IMPORTANT: Add Environment Variables BEFORE creating the service:**
   
   **OR if service already exists:**
   - Go to your service dashboard
   - Click on "Environment" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Add Environment Variable" for each variable
   
   **Required Environment Variables:**
   - **Key**: `SMTP_EMAIL` ‚Üí **Value**: `your-email@gmail.com`
   - **Key**: `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD` ‚Üí **Value**: `your-16-char-app-password`
   - **Key**: `NODE_ENV` ‚Üí **Value**: `production`
   - **Key**: `PORT` ‚Üí **Value**: Leave empty (Render sets this automatically) or `10000`
   
   **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL TIPS:**
   - No spaces around the `=` sign in Render
   - No quotes needed around values
   - Case-sensitive: Use exactly `SMTP_EMAIL` and `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD`
   - After adding/updating environment variables, you MUST manually trigger a redeploy
   - Click "Save Changes" after adding each variable

6. Click "Create Web Service" (or "Save Changes" if updating)
7. **Manually trigger redeploy** (if you added env vars after creation):
   - Go to "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
8. Wait for deployment (about 5-10 minutes)
9. Copy your service URL (e.g., `https://clinic-os-backend.onrender.com`)

### Step 3: Update Frontend Config

Update your frontend/mobile app's backend configuration file:

```typescript
export const BACKEND_CONFIG = {
  DEV_URL: 'http://localhost:3001',
  PROD_URL: 'https://clinic-os-backend.onrender.com', // Your Render URL
  ENVIRONMENT: 'production' as 'development' | 'production',
};
```

## Option 2: Deploy to Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub
3. Select your backend repository
4. Add environment variables (SMTP credentials)
5. Railway will automatically detect Node.js and deploy
6. Copy your deployment URL
7. Update `PROD_URL` in your frontend config

## Option 3: Use Your Public IP (Temporary Solution)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This only works if your device is on the same network as your development machine.

### Step 1: Find Your Public IP
Visit [whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com) to get your public IP.

### Step 2: Configure Port Forwarding
In your router settings:
- Forward port 3001 to your local machine
- Allow incoming connections on port 3001

### Step 3: Update Config
```typescript
PROD_URL: 'http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3001',
ENVIRONMENT: 'production',
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: This solution is temporary and requires your computer to be on and your router to allow port forwarding.

## Testing Backend Deployment

Test your deployed backend:

```bash
curl https://your-backend-url.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.45
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Environment variables not found / "SMTP_EMAIL: ‚ùå NOT SET"
**This is the most common issue!** Follow these steps:

1. **Verify variables are set in Render:**
   - Go to your Render service dashboard
   - Click "Environment" in the left sidebar
   - Check that `SMTP_EMAIL` and `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD` are listed
   - Verify spelling (case-sensitive, no typos)

2. **Check variable values:**
   - Click on each variable to edit and verify the value is correct
   - For `SMTP_EMAIL`: Should be your full Gmail address (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com`)
   - For `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD`: Should be exactly 16 characters, no spaces or quotes

3. **After adding/updating variables, manually redeploy:**
   - Render does NOT automatically redeploy when you add environment variables
   - Go to "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
   - OR click "Events" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

4. **Verify variable names are exact:**
   - ‚úÖ Correct: `SMTP_EMAIL`, `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD`
   - ‚ùå Wrong: `SMTP_Email`, `SMTP_APP_PASS`, `smtp_email`, `SMTPEMAIL`

5. **Check deployment logs:**
   - After redeploy, check the logs
   - Look for the "üîç Environment check:" section
   - If still showing "‚ùå NOT SET", the variables aren't being passed to the service

### Issue: "Network request failed" in client app
**Solution**: Check that `ENVIRONMENT` is set to `'production'` and `PROD_URL` is correct in your client app configuration.

### Issue: Backend returns 500 error
**Solution**: Check your backend logs for missing environment variables or SMTP configuration issues.

### Issue: OTP emails not sent
**Solution**: Verify that `SMTP_EMAIL` and `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD` are set correctly in your deployment environment. Check the deployment logs for SMTP connection errors.

### Issue: Backend times out
**Solution**: Render free tier instances sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. Consider upgrading or use Railway/Render paid tier.

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to Git
2. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production (Render provides this automatically)
3. **Monitoring**: Set up error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
4. **Backup**: Keep regular backups of your backend configuration
5. **Testing**: Test backend deployment before using in production

## Quick Reference

- **Development**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Production**: Update your client app to use the deployed backend URL
- **Environment Variables**: Set in your hosting platform's dashboard

## Next Steps

1. Deploy backend to Render/Railway
2. Get deployment URL
3. Update `PROD_URL` in client app configuration
4. Set `ENVIRONMENT: 'production'` in client app
5. Test OTP functionality with the deployed backend
